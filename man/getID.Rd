\title{Extracts a fish identification from a vector of image file names}
\usage{
getID(x, IDpattern, IDreplace, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A charachter vector of image file names.}

\item{IDpattern}{A regular expression used to extract the fish identification value from the image file names in \code{x}. Defaults to extracting all values after the last underscore in the image file name (sans extension). Can be set with \code{\link{RFBCoptions}}.}

\item{IDreplace}{A string to replace the expression matched in \code{IDpattern}. Can be set with \code{\link{RFBCoptions}}.}

\item{\dots}{Parameters to be given to \code{\link{sub}}.}
}
\value{
Character vector.
}
\description{
This returns a vector of fish identification values from a vector of image file names.
}
\details{
By default it is assumed that the ID value follows an underscore at the end/tail of image file name (sans extension). Other patterns can be used by giving a suitable regular expression to \code{IDpattern} and possibly a replacement (usually a group identifier such as \dQuote{\\1}) in \code{IDreplace}. You may find the webpage at \code{spannbaueradam.shinyapps.io/r_regex_tester/} useful for identifying the necessary regular expression pattern for your situation.

If the pattern in \code{IDpattern} does not exist in each element of \code{x} then an error will be returned. In other words, the fish identification value must be in the same \dQuote{place} (based on \code{IDpattern}) in EVERY image filename.

If the vector of returned IDs contains any duplicated values then a warning will be issued.

The list of image file names in a given folder/directory may be obtained with \code{\link{listFiles}}.

\examples{
## These are possible vectors of image file names with the fish ID after
##   the last underscore ... which is the default behavior
ex1 <- c("Scale_1.jpg","Scale_2.jpg")
ex2 <- c("Kiyi_472.bmp","Kiy_567.jpg")
ex3 <- c("PWF_MI345.tiff","PWF_WI567.tiff")
ex4 <- c("LKT_oto_23.jpg","LKT_finray_34.jpg")

## These are extracted fish IDs
getID(ex1)
getID(ex2)
getID(ex3)
getID(ex4)

## These are possible vectors of image file names with the fish ID NOT after
##   the last underscore. This requires judicious use of IDpattern= and
##   IDreplace= (similar to pattern= and replacement- as used in sub()).

### fish ID at the beginning of the name
ex5 <- c("1_Scale.jpg","2_Scale.jpg")
getID(ex5,IDpattern="\\\\_.*")

### fish ID between two underscores (might be used if multiple images for one ID)
ex6 <- c("DWS_100_1.jpg","DWS_101_2,jpg")
getID(ex6,IDpattern=".*\\\\_(.+?)\\\\_.*",IDreplace="\\\\1")
ex7 <- c("DWS_MI100_1.jpg","DWS_MI100_2,jpg")
getID(ex7,IDpattern=".*\\\\_(.+?)\\\\_.*",IDreplace="\\\\1")

### Will be warned if the returned IDs are not unique
\dontrun{
ex8 <- c("Ruffe_456.jpg","Ruffe_456.jpg","Ruffe_567.jpg")
getID(ex8)
}
