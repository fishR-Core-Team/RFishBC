\description{
The RFishBC package helps fisheries scientists collect growth data from calcified structures and back-calculate estimated lengths at previous ages. The package is intended to replace much of the functionality provided by the now out-date fishBC software. See the package webpage at [https://derekogle.com/RFishBC].
