Description: Helps fisheries scientists collect measurements from calcified
    structures and back-calculate estimated lengths at previous ages using
    standard procedures and models. This is intended to replace much of the
    functionality provided by the now out-dated 'fishBC' software
    (<https://fisheries.org/bookstore/all-titles/software/70317/>).
