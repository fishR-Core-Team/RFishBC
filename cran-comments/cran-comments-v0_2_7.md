* This updates the RFishBC package that was archived earlier this month. This fixes all errors and notes that caused the archive, and includes some other updates. Importantly my e-mail address has been updated throughout (this may be why I did not receive notice from CRAN about the errors that caused the archiving).

## Notes
* If there is a note about "fishBC" being misspelled in the description, then note that this is not a misspelling.

## Testing Environments
* My Windows machine.
* Win Builder -- old-release, release, and development.
* GitHub Action (R-CMD-check.yaml)
